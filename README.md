# Midterm Project IT 1000

  Welcome to my Midterm for _INFOTC 1000_. My name is [Sergio Pico](Aboutme.md) and I am using this as a portfolio of some experience I have gained throughout my years doing IT.  I have worked on computers and electronics since I was a young kid. I was that kid all family members would come to for help with their phones, computers, tv, xbox, pretty much everything. This is demonstrated now in my [experience](experience.md) in the IT field. I am actually now majoring in **Information Technology**. I have gotten to do some pretty awesome things like [coding](pythonexperience.md) jokes for my friends.
